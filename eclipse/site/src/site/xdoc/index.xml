      <p>
        Apache Doxia Eclipse Editors is a collection of Eclipse plugins under development.
        It includes several new tools to support all
        <a href="/doxia/references/index.html">Apache Doxia formats</a> in Eclipse,
        i.e. APT, Confluence, Simplified DocBook, FML, TWiki, XDOC and Xhtml.
        Moreover, it comes also with wizards.
      </p>
      <subsection name="What can Apache Doxia Eclipse Editors do for you?">
        <p>
          These Eclipse plugins:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Support all Apache Doxia file formats (as of version 1.3, ie. Markdown not yet supported)</li>
          <li>Show the rendering of any Apache Doxia file directly, without running <code>mvn site</code> or <code>mvn site:run</code></li>
          <li>Support source level color and styles highlighting in the editors</li>
          <li>Provide helpers to insert commonly used patterns in each format (bold, italic, monospaced, link, table)</li>
          <li>Include wizards for creating new Apache Doxia files</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          See the <a href="usage.html">usage page</a> for screenshots and more information.

      <subsection name="Brief History">
        <p>
           This project was started in 2008 by Vincent Siveton (see <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DOXIATOOLS-8">DOXIATOOLS-8</a>)
           but was never released. In August 2011, Herv√© Boutemy wanted to revive the project. Benson Margulies was willing to help
           by making a correct Maven build using OSGi and <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tycho/">Tycho</a>. Here we go now.
